<p align='justify'>
  I used machine learning to analyze Tinderâ€™s impact on relationship success based on social polling data of 1,896 university students. Based on my official competition score, I achieved over 91.6% accuracy using a stacking algorithm composed of random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. As of writing, I placed in the top 1.5% (11th out of 737 entries). <br>
